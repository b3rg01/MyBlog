### Description

<div src="margin-top: 60px;"></div>

In the early summer of 2017, WannaCry was unleashed on the world. Widely considered to be one of the most devastating malware infections to date, WannaCry left a trail of destruction in its wake. 
WannaCry is a classic ransomware sample; more specifically, it is a ransomware crypto worm, which means that it can encrypt individual hosts and had the capability to propagate through a network on its own.
Hereâ€™s my own analysis of this particular specimen.

In this blog post, I will analyze the initial stage of WannaCry ransomware sample. Please note that I'm new at this and I will try to provide a detail technical analysis of the initial stage to the best of my abilities. 
Hope you will enjoy this!!

### Basic Static Analysis

In this section I used a simple tool named `pe studio` to get a general understanding of the loader. After unpacking I also used a command line tool named `floss`

- In this screenshot we can clearly see that `pestudio` is not able to properly counts the imports and the libraries which indicates to me that this sample might be packed
- also we can note that there is a high entropy. I will have to unpack it to be able to proceed my analysis

- We can also see that the raw size is lower than the virtual size which might be another indicator that this sample is packed

  >  Before proceeding further in our basic static analysis we will perform the unpacking steps with x32bdg, since we are focusing on the analysis, I will not put the process in this blog

- Interesting strings, Before unpacking

- After unpacking, I can see some interesting parts of some URLs
	- `/photo.png?id=%0.2X%0.8X%0.8X%s`
	- `boldidiotruss.xyz`
	- `nizaoplov.xyz`
	- `153ishak.best`
	- `ilu21plane.xyz`
- I can also see some interesting libraries being imported which indicates to me that something is being downloaded
	- `WinHttpQueryDataAvailable`
	- `WinHttpConnect`
	- `WinHttpSendRequest`
	- `WinHttpCloseHandle`
	- `WinHttpSetOption`
	- `WinHttpOpenRequest`
	- `WinHttpReadData`
	- `WinHttpQueryHeaders`
	- `WinHttpOpen`
	- `WinHttpReceiveResponse`

- By detonating the malware we notice that it tried to create a file named `photo.png`

- We can also see that a `TLSv1.2` connection is made to `boldidiotruss.xyz`
