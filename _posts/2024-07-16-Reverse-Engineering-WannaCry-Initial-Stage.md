In the early summer of 2017, WannaCry was unleashed on the world. Widely considered to be one of the most devastating malware infections to date, WannaCry left a trail of destruction in its wake. 
WannaCry is a classic ransomware sample; more specifically, it is a ransomware crypto worm, which means that it can encrypt individual hosts and had the capability to propagate through a network on its own.
Hereâ€™s my own analysis of this particular specimen.

In this blog post, I will analyze the initial stage of WannaCry ransomware sample. Please note that I'm new at this and I will try to provide a detail technical analysis of the initial stage to the best of my abilities. 
Hope you will enjoy this!!
